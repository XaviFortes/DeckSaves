- **Smart Storage**: Works with both S3 (cloud) and local storage backends
- **Auto-Pinning**: Automatically pins weekly versions to preserve important saves

### üìã Version History
- **Timeline View**: See all versions of your save files in chronological order
- **File Details**: View file size, timestamp, hash, and descriptions for each version
- **Pin Management**: Pin important versions (before boss fights, achievements, etc.)
- **Cleanup**: Automatically removes old versions while preserving pinned ones

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è Restore Capabilities
- **One-Click Restore**: Restore any previous version with a single click

- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles file conflicts intelligently

## How to Use

### 1. Versioned Sync
In the Games list, you'll now see two sync options for each game:
- **Sync Now**: Regular sync (legacy)
- **üïí Versioned Sync**: Sync with automatic versioning

Click "Versioned Sync" to sync your game saves with version tracking enabled.

### 2. View Version History
1. Click the **üìã History** button next to any game
2. Browse through all versions of your save files
3. See details like:
   - When each version was created
   - File size and hash
   - Whether it's pinned
   - Description (if any)

### 3. Restore Previous Versions
1. Open the version history for a game
2. Find the version you want to restore
3. Click the **‚Ü©Ô∏è Restore** button
4. Confirm the restoration
5. Your save file will be restored to that exact state

### 4. Pin Important Versions
1. In the version history, click the **üìç** button next to any version
2. Pinned versions show a **üìå Pinned** badge
3. Pinned versions are protected from automatic cleanup
4. Use this before:
   - Important boss fights
   - Achievement attempts
   - Risky decisions
   - Game updates

### 5. Cleanup Old Versions
- Click **üßπ Cleanup Old** to remove old, unpinned versions
- Automatic cleanup runs based on your configuration:
  - Keeps last 10 versions per file (configurable)
  - Removes versions older than 30 days (configurable)
  - Always preserves pinned versions

## Configuration

The versioning system uses these default settings:
- **Auto-Pin Strategy**: Weekly (pins one version per week)
- **Max Versions**: 10 per file
- **Retention Period**: 30 days
- **Compression**: Enabled
- **Storage**: Uses your existing S3 or local storage configuration

## Storage Locations

### Cloud Storage (S3)
Versions are stored in your configured S3 bucket under:
```
your-bucket/
  versions/
    GameName/
      SaveFile.dat/
        2025-07-25T10-30-00_abc123.dat
        2025-07-25T11-00-00_def456.dat
```

### Local Storage
Versions are stored locally under:
```
~/.decksaves/versions/
  GameName/
    SaveFile.dat/
      2025-07-25T10-30-00_abc123.dat
      2025-07-25T11-00-00_def456.dat
```

## Benefits

### Save Game Safety
- **Never lose saves**: Every sync creates a recoverable version
- **Corruption protection**: If a save gets corrupted, restore a previous version
- **Experiment freely**: Try risky gameplay knowing you can always go back

### Peace of Mind
- **Automatic backups**: No manual intervention required
- **Smart retention**: Keeps important versions, cleans up clutter
- **Easy recovery**: User-friendly interface for browsing and restoring

### Storage Efficiency
- **Compression**: Reduces storage usage for save files
- **Deduplication**: Same content = same hash = one storage entry
- **Smart cleanup**: Removes old versions while preserving important ones

## Troubleshooting

### No Version History Shown
- Make sure you've used "Versioned Sync" at least once
- Check that your storage backend (S3/Local) is configured correctly
- Verify network connectivity for S3 storage

### Restore Failed
- Ensure you have write permissions to the save file location
- Check that the game is not currently running
- Verify the target version still exists in storage

### Storage Issues
- For S3: Check AWS credentials and bucket permissions
- For Local: Verify disk space and write permissions
- Check the application logs for detailed error messages

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Save Paths
- If a game has multiple save file paths, the History button shows versions for the first path
- Future versions will allow selecting which save path to view

### API Integration
The versioning system exposes these Tauri commands for custom integrations:
- `sync_game_with_versioning`
- `get_version_history`
- `restore_version`
- `pin_version`
- `cleanup_old_versions`

## What's Next

Planned improvements include:
- **Save Path Selection**: Choose which save file to view history for
- **Bulk Operations**: Pin/restore multiple versions at once
- **Version Notes**: Add custom descriptions to versions
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter versions by date, size, or tags
- **Sync Scheduling**: Automatic versioned syncing on a schedule
